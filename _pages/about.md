Jorge Ortiz is an Assisant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University and director of the Cyber-Physical Intelligence Lab (CyPhyI Lab -- pronouned SciFi Lab).  My research is in applied machine learning in sensor-based systems with a particular focus on sustainability and healthcare.  More specifically, my work examines how to use machine learning to enable smart sensor-based systems and insights.
